                                    that this window admits natural light into the room and also provides good
                                    ventilation. This makes it a functional and also a fashionable addition that can be
                                    incorporated in any building. In this article, we discuss more about this product in
                                    detail.</p>

                                <h4 class="card-title">Type</h4>
                                <p class="card-title"><b>Fixed Louvre:</b> This louvre has slats which are fixed
                                    permanently and do not move. They are fixed at a particular angle to allow light and
                                    air at certain levels while maintaining privacy. It is ideal for toilets, closets,
                                    and other utility spaces where you want the air to circulate at all times to avoid
                                    odour.</p>
                                <p class="card-title"><b>Adjustable Louvre:</b> These louvres are adjustable so that the
                                    user can regulate the amount of either light or fresh air that is allowed into the
                                    building. It affords choices to the user in terms of which way they prefer to use
                                    the window. This system is most appropriate for living rooms or bedrooms where one
                                    wants to regulate the flow of either light or air while maintaining their privacy at
                                    the same time.</p>
                                <p class="card-title"><b>Operable Louvre:</b> This louvre can be opened and closed
                                    completely either manually or with a motor. This allows users to have full control
                                    over the device and how they want the light and ventilation to occur. It is best
                                    suited for outdoor spaces where maximum control over the light and air is required.
                                </p>
                                <h4 class="card-title">Style</h4>
                                <p class="card-title"><b>Horizontal Louvre:</b> This Louvre can be set horizontally as
                                    seen from the name given to it. These designs can be implemented in both
                                    conventional houses and modern houses. This design has a simple and stylish
                                    appearance and will enhance the appearance of the environment in a big way.</p>
                                <p class="card-title"><b>Vertical Louvre:</b> If there is a horizontal Louvre, there has
                                    to be a vertical Louvre too. These designs are usually seen in commercial buildings,
                                    although it is used in residential settings too. This design gives the structure a
                                    tall and elegant look which suits modern and minimalist designs.</p>
                                <p class="card-title">Depending on the region, there are other types of louvres which
                                    are made of wood or metal and may have wider or narrower slats to suit the climatic
                                    condition of the places. Those who prefer open spaces, rustic settings, and relaxed
                                    environments may go for such louvres.</p>

                                <h4 class="card-title">Benefits</h4>
                                <p class="card-title"><b>Light Control:</b> Louvres allow you to adjust the amount of
                                    natural light entering a room. Whether you want to block out the sun completely or
                                    let in a soft glow, you have the option to control it.</p>
                                <p class="card-title"><b>Ventilation:</b> By adjusting the angle of the slats, you can
                                    control the airflow into a room. This is especially beneficial in areas with high
                                    humidity or where natural ventilation is a better option.</p>
                                <p class="card-title"><b>Privacy:</b> You can tilt the slats to block the view from
                                    outside while still allowing light to enter. This setting is perfect for bedrooms
                                    and bathrooms.</p>
                                <p class="card-title"><b>Aesthetic Appeal:</b> These are available in various materials,
                                    colours, and finishes, and louvres can complement any interior design. Whether you
                                    prefer a modern, minimalist look or a traditional, cosy feel, there’s a louvre style
                                    to match.</p>
                                <p class="card-title"><b>Energy Efficiency:</b> Louvres can regulate indoor temperatures
                                    by controlling the amount of sunlight and airflow into any space. This reduces the
                                    need for heating or cooling by using A/C or thermostat.</p>
