                        <p class="card-text"><a href="https://sohom.in/">French doors and windows</a> are known for their timeless elegance and the ability to seamlessly integrate the indoor and outdoor environment. This design originated during the Renaissance period and has evolved since then. However, it remains true to its spirit by offering homeowners a classic, functional, and aesthetically appealing design for all. Here are some tips to consider if you wish to make an informed decision while making the purchase:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Material</b> Be sure to choose a material that complements your home while also providing high levels of durability and functionality. This material usually includes wood, fiberglass, and steel. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"> <b> Glass</b> French doors and windows contain elaborate glass panels which is an integral part of this style scheme. In addition to using generic glass for the panels, buyers can also choose high-quality glass which are thicker and have better insulation property. Low-E coatings are also used to reduce UV rays.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Style </b>There are various design schemes that can be broadly classified as classic, modern, and rustic. You can select a style that works best for your home and your preference.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Configuration</b> Depending on the requirement, one can have single or double doors setup while the opening of the window can be of various styles, such as casement, awning, or double hung, etc. Choose a style that works best for your home.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Security</b> The doors and windows have multiple point locking systems, reinforced glass, and sturdy build. Additional security measures like window bars can also be incorporated into the system.</p>
                            </li>
                             <li>
                                <p class="card-text">   <b>Energy Efficiency </b>Look for doors and windows with good insulation properties to improve their energy efficiency. Better sealing will ensure that there is no leakage of air whether it's summer or winter, which will ensure the temperature inside is regulated to a greater extent. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                 <b>Maintenance</b> Choose materials that require minimal maintenance throughout their lifespan. These materials should be able to resist fading, warping, peeling, and other issues they may face due to continued exposure to the elements. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text">
                                   <b>Warranty </b>Be sure to check the warranty before you purchase the device. A good warranty shows the confidence manufacturers have in their offerings and provides its customers the assurance they need before they purchase the item. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            
                        </ol>
