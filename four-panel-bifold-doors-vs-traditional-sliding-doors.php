                                <p class="card-title">Between these two styles, a 4-panel door and a traditional sliding
                                    door have their benefits that can be more appropriate for one or another customer.
                                    In this article, we will explore few points to help make the right decision:</p>

                                <h4 class="card-title">Space Utilisation</h4>
                                <p class="card-title">A <a
                                        href=how-to-choose-the-right-plastic-door-and-window-manufacturers.php>4-panel
                                        bifold door</a> can be folded neatly, which offers residents more space once the
                                    door is fully closed. This door system provides more space and is particularly
                                    suitable for connecting outdoor and indoor areas of the house.</p>
                                <p class="card-title">In the case of the traditional sliding door, the space covered by
                                    this system can be reduced to half of its original width since one door can slide
                                    over the other door. While these doors make good use of the space available to them,
                                    they may not provide as wide an opening compared to bifold doors.</p>

                                <h4 class="card-title">Aesthetics</h4>
                                <p class="card-title">Bifold doors are modern, stylish, and elegant and can offer better
                                    depth and layer to the entire space. They work very well in contemporary house
                                    designs.</p>
                                <p class="card-title">When it comes to sliding doors, it offers a minimalist and simple
                                    look that can blend well with modern and traditional designs. They provide a sleek
                                    and even look which is highly sought after in minimalist house designs.</p>

                                <h4 class="card-title">Functionality</h4>
                                    <p class="card-title">Bifold doors are more versatile and can be opened partially or
                                        fully. This makes it ideal for settings where homeowners prefer wide openings in
                                        their house with minimal clutter.</p>
                                    <p class="card-title">With sliding doors, their operation is limited and suitable
                                        for sections of the house where there is high traffic and users prefer ease of
                                        use.</p>

                                    <h4 class="card-title">Cost</h4>
                                    <p class="card-title">A bifold door is expected to be costlier since its mechanism
                                        is complex and requires more materials to get it operational. The installation
                                        of this door will also need a team of specialists who are familiar with the
                                        workings of the system.</p>
                                    <p class="card-title">When it comes to sliding doors, its mechanism is simple and
                                        does not require any expensive parts. They are easy to install and a
                                        cost-effective option for homeowners who want to be on a tight budget.</p>
                                    <p class="card-title">All in all, go for a 4-panel bifold door if you have a lot of
                                        open spaces in your home and wish to give it a modern, chic look while
                                        maximising your space without compromising on quality. In case you prefer
                                        something simple, a traditional sliding door is a better choice for you. This
                                        door system is perfect for small spaces where opening the door completely is not
                                        required.</p>

                                    <p class="card-title">The best choice depends on your specific needs, budget, and
                                        design preferences.</p>
