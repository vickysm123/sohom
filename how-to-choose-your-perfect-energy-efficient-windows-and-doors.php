                        <p class="card-text">Choosing energy-efficient windows and doors is a great way to save money on energy bills and also contribute towards reducing our carbon footprint in the long run. Windows and doors are a part of our homes that allow us to interact with the environment outside. For this reason, we must ensure the product works well and lets in the desired amount of light and air while adding to the overall aesthetic appeal of the house. Here are some ways to choose the right <a href="https://sohom.in/about.php">energy-efficient windows and doors:</a></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text">Understand the performance ratings of the material with which the windows and doors are made. This will provide information regarding a product's insulation value, solar heat gain, and the amount of visible light it allows. It is advised to go for lower U-Factor and SHGC values for better energy efficiency. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Identify Needs:</b> Determine what exactly you need. Whether you are looking to manage the temperature, increase natural light, and improve the overall energy efficiency of the home, understanding your requirements will help you choose the right product.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Better Security:</b>These windows have multiple locking points, making it difficult for the intruders to open. The locking mechanism is highly sophisticated which makes it tamper-proof. This gives peace of mind to homeowners in terms of security.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Right Material:</b>The material used to make the windows and doors has a major impact on the energy efficiency of the house. Some of the common options include wood, vinyl, fibre, aluminium, steel, etc. Each material comes with its own set of functionalities, insulation properties, and durability among others. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Double or Triple Glazing:</b>Certain windows and door variants come with multiple layers of glass which is more efficient compared to single-pane windows. It offers better insulation and heat retention. Also, look for products with specially developed coatings that improve energy efficiency.</p>
                            </li>
                             <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Tightness of Seals:</b>Look for windows and doors that can prevent air leakage effectively. This will do a good job of maintaining the indoor temperature and leakage of air which is useful both in hot and cold weather.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Energy Certification:</b>Many products come with certifications backed by a government agency that certifies their energy efficiency. Ensure that you look at the rating applicable to the item you wish to purchase to determine if it meets your specific requirements and performance levels. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Climatic Condition:</b>Be sure to keep a tab of the climate where your house is located. Items used in a predominantly hotter region may not work as effectively in a colder region. Determine which material, product rating, and design suit best according to the local climatic conditions.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>Expert Advice:</b>Take the advice of professionals who are engaged in house construction so they can direct you to the most trusted vendor who can give you personalised recommendations and services. </p>
                            </li>
